Welcome random people on the internet!<br>
</p>

<p>
I always wanted a blog but by the time I actually put together one that I'm ok with,
I suddenly seem to have lost the ability to write!
so I guess the one I prepared for the home page should do..
</p>

<p>
I post stuff about technology, terminal and other things. This website is generated using vimwiki and is best viewed on a terminal browser like lynx.<br>
</p>

<p>
I see tech as a tool and needless to say I'm always looking forward for better and effective ways to use them. I hate boring repetetive tasks and try to automate wherever I can. I'll try to post about all these as much as I can and meanwhile you can checkout my rss feed. Also feel free to mail me about your cool automation ideas and vim tips lol.
